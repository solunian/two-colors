# two colors :red_circle: :large_blue_circle:

A game collection that uses only two main colors. 
Designed to help people correct "lazy eye" (amblyopia) by using those red-blue tinted glasses (like for 3D movies).

Disclaimer: This is a not a legitimate medical treatment. Don't sue me, please. But seriously, are you actually using this?

## Games Completed

- [x] tetra
- [ ] tanks from wii play: wasd to move, mouse/click to fire bullets, space bar for dropping a mine
- [ ] getting chased

## Dev Notes

### Build

Refer to the love2d docs for game distribution [here](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution)!

### Color

Look through only one tinted lens of glasses, and adjust the color until it turns near black.
Looking through a pure blue filter would only show blue light, and same with everything else.

Match the opposite color into the black background.

### Tetra

Recreating the famous stacking game is more complex than one might think.
The weird things is coding rotation, srs kicks, and movement things like
ARR, DAS, and DCD.

Heavily referenced tetrio and other tables for specific details.

All functionality essentials implemented.

### Tanks

Coding rn!
