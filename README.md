## Dev Notes

- this probably doesn't work

- trying to gain the respect of webdev haters and "low-level" lovers
- Makefile use "\t" indentation, but all code should use two spaces instead

## getting raylib working

### linux (i use ubuntu)

- to add headers and lib archive for the compiler, headers must be located at `/usr/local/include` and lib should be at `/usr/local/lib`
- use the raylib wiki because it is a little messy
- reference the Makefile for running
